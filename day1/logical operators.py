x=5
print(x >4 and x<9)#Returns True if both statements are true

x=6
print(x <4 or x<10)#Returns True if one of the statements is true

x=5
print(not(x >4 and x<10))#returns False because not is used to reverse the result


#Test if a number is less than 5 or greater than 10:
x = 5
print(x < 7 or x > 15)

x=5
print(not(x>3 and x<10))
